1. Define the Objectives
Analyze road accident trends.
Identify patterns based on time, vehicle type, road type, weather, and other conditions.
Compare current year (CY) data with previous year (PY) data.
Highlight actionable insights for policymakers or transportation authorities.
2. Collect and Prepare Data
Sources:
Government or transport authority databases.
Public datasets on road accidents.
Manually compiled reports.
Data Requirements:
Accident details (type, severity, location, etc.).
Time (day, month, year).
Vehicle type, road type, weather conditions.
Urban vs. rural area classification.
Clean and Process Data:
Handle missing or inconsistent values.
Create derived fields (e.g., accident rates, severity categories).
Ensure time-series data is uniform.
3. Import Data into Power BI
Use Power Query to load data:
Connect to sources (Excel, SQL Server, CSV, etc.).
Perform transformations like removing duplicates, renaming columns, and setting data types.
4. Design the Data Model
Create Relationships:
Establish relationships between tables, e.g., link accidents to vehicles, roads, and weather.
Add Measures:
Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculations, e.g.:
% Change = (CY - PY) / PY * 100
Fatal Severity Rate = Fatal Accidents / Total Accidents.
5. Build Visualizations
Key Metrics Cards:
Display total accidents, casualties, and percentage changes using KPI cards.
Charts:
Bar charts for vehicle types, road types, and urban/rural distribution.
Line chart for monthly trends (CY vs. PY).
Filters:
Add slicers for year, vehicle type, and weather conditions.
Advanced Visuals:
Heatmap for accidents by day of the week.
Conditional formatting to highlight severe accident zones.
6. Design Dashboard Layout
Header:
Include title and brief description of the dashboard purpose.
Sections:
Casualty Overview: Key metrics and trends.
Breakdown Analysis: Visualizations by vehicle type, road type, and light conditions.
Geo-analysis (if applicable): Map accidents based on location.
Ensure interactivity by linking charts and slicers.
7. Validate Results
Cross-check values with source data.
Verify calculations (e.g., percentage changes and trends).
Ensure filters and slicers work as expected.
8. Add Insights and Recommendations
Include commentary on key findings:
E.g., "Car-related accidents account for 80% of total incidents."
Highlight notable trends like "Accidents decrease significantly in urban areas."
9. Publish and Share
Publish the dashboard to Power BI Service for sharing.
Set up scheduled refresh if data updates periodically.
Assign access controls based on audience (e.g., public vs. private).
